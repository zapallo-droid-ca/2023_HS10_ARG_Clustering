# Clustering Argentina Partners in Maize International Trade
Argentine Internacional HS10 Commodities (Cereals) Trade Partners Clustering by Aggregated Metrics and Time Series using ML Techniques

**Project Summary:** [link to notebook](https://github.com/zapallo-droid-ca/2023.HS10-ARG.Clustering/blob/main/summary.ipynb)

**The project was made using three different approaches:**
* Aggregating the time series using some usual metrics [link to notebook](https://github.com/zapallo-droid-ca/2023.HS10-ARG.Clustering/blob/main/exp01.Maize.BM.ipynb)
* Applying Dynamic Time Warping [link to notebook](https://github.com/zapallo-droid-ca/2023.HS10-ARG.Clustering/blob/main/exp02.Maize.TWD.ipynb)
* Decomposing the Time Series and clustering by each component [link to notebook](https://github.com/zapallo-droid-ca/2023.HS10-ARG.Clustering/blob/main/exp03.Maize.TSD.ipynb)

  **The results have been gathered in a Power BI Dashboard** [link to dashboard](https://github.com/zapallo-droid-ca/2023.HS10-ARG.Clustering/blob/main/dash01.pbix)
  In case of interest, please download the dashboard and open it with the Power BI desktop.
